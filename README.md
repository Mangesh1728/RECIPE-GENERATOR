# RECIPE-GENERATOR
This project utilizes a pretrained T5 model to generate recipes based on provided ingredients, demonstrating natural language processing capabilities for culinary tasks. It includes functions for input processing, recipe generation, and output formatting, enhancing recipe accessibility and creativity.
Below is a sample README file for your project:

---

## Features
- **Ingredient-Based Recipe Generation**: Users can input a list of ingredients, and the model generates recipes based on the provided ingredients.
- **Output Formatting**: The generated recipes are formatted into sections such as title, ingredients, and directions for better readability.
- **Customizable Generation Parameters**: Users can adjust generation parameters such as maximum length and sampling methods for recipe generation.

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the project code, providing a list of ingredients as input.
3. The model generates recipes based on the provided ingredients, which are displayed with proper formatting.

## Example
```python
items = [
    "macaroni, butter, salt, bacon, milk, flour, pepper, cream corn",
    "provolone cheese, bacon, bread, ginger"
]
generated = generation_function(items)
for text in generated:
    # Process and print the generated recipes
    ...
```
